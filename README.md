# Hunt-Utils  

Hunt-Utils is a player-made utility program for Hunt: Showdown.  
I didn't want to always remember and reconfigure my settings each time Hunt is reinstalled, updated or simply for the Test Servers.  
So I wrote this small program to backup settings, and thought I'd just include a Loadout Randomizer for fun.  

## (Planned) Features  

- Backup Config File
- Match Stats
- Loadout Randomizer
